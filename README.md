This project was to design and code an online shop for rain jackets, where the focus was on creating an appealing design that would reflect an outdoors lifestyle for adults. The colors are supposed to give a fresh and modern look. 

Description:

This website had to display the following pages:
-Home
-List of Jackets
-A jacket specific page
-A checkout page
-A checkout success
-About

The goal was to deliver a functioning, responsive website using semantic HTML and simple-to-read CSS.
An important part was also to make sure the website looked good across screen sizes and take into accountability WCAG and accessibility.
